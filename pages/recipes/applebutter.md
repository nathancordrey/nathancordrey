# Instant Pot Apple Butter

An easy, hands-off apple butter made in the Instant Pot.  
Great on toast, biscuits, pancakes, or straight from the spoon.

## Ingredients

- 1 1/2 cups light brown sugar
- 1 tbsp cinnamon

2. Pour in apple cider, lemon juice, brown sugar, spices, and salt.
3. Seal lid and cook on **High Pressure** for **60 minutes**.
4. Let pressure release naturally for 10 minutes, then quick release.
5. Blend until smooth using an immersion blender (or carefully transfer to a blender).
6. Set Instant Pot to **Sauté (High)** and cook uncovered for **20–40 minutes**, stirring often, until thickened.
7. Stir in vanilla extract and remove from heat.
