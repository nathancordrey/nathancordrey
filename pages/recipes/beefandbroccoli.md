# Beef and Broccoli

A quick beef and broccoli for a weeknight dinner!

## Ingredients

## Beef and Broccoli

- 1 lb flank steak, very thinly sliced into bite sized pieces
- 2 tbsp Olive oil, divided
- 1 lb broccoli, cut into 6 cups of florets
- 2 tsp sesame seeds

## Stir Fry Sauce


- 1 tsp ginger
- 2 tsp garlic, grated or finely chopped
- 1/2 cup hot water
- 6 tbsp soy sauce
- 3 tbsp packed light brown sugar
- 1 1/2 tbsp corn starch
- 1/4 tsp black pepper


## Instructions

1. Start cooking white rice
2. Cover and freeze steak for 30 minutes for easier slicing. Thinly slice the steak.
3. Combine all stir fry sauce ingredients in a bowl, stir well to dissolve the sugar, and set aside
4. Place a large skillet over medium heat and add 1 tbsp oil. Add broccoli florets and saute 4-5 minutes, partially covered with lid, stirring or tossing several times until broccoli is bright green and crisp-tender then remove from pan.
5. Increase heat to high heat and add 1 tbsp oil. Add beef in a single layer and saute 2 minutes per side or just until cooked through. Quickly pull out a piece to test.
6. Add the sauce, reduce heat to medium/low and simmer 3-4 minutes. It will thicken. Add broccoli and stir to combine. Stir in 1-2 tbsp water to thin the sauce if desired. Serve over white rice.
