# Canned Spaghetti Sauce

Use up those summer tomatoes!
  
## Ingredients
- 25 lb tomatoes
- 5 medium onions (7-8 cups chopped)
- 4 red bell peppers
- 1 green bell pepper
- 4 (6oz) cans tomato paste
- 1/4 cup soy sauce
- 3 tbs worcestershire sauce
- 2/3 cup packed brown sugar
- 1/4 cup salt
- 1- cloves garlic chopped/minced
- 3 tbs oregano (dried)
- 3 tbs basil (dried)
- 2 tsp red pepper flakes
- 2 bay leaves
- 1 1/4 cup lemon juice for jars

## Instructions
1. Fill a large pot or Dutch oven half way with water, and bring to a boil. Using a slotted spoon, add tomatoes one at a time until you cant fit anymore (8-10).
2. Boil for 1-2 minutes. Remove tomatoes one at a time with slotted spoon and plunge into an ice water bath. Peel and quarter tomatoes.
3. In a food processor, cover and process green peppers and onions in batches until finely chopped (if you want to add extra flavor, saute the peppers and onions in a little oil and pinch of salt before processing).
4. In a large stockpot, combine the tomatoes (do not discard excess juices from the tomatoes), onion/pepper mixture, tomato paste, soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, brown sugar, salt, garlic, oregano, basil, pepper flakes, and bay leaves.
5. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered, for 4-5 hours, stirring every 15 minutes or so (tomatoes burn easily so keep an eye on it). Discard bay leaves. If you want to make your sauce thick and smooth, use an immersion blender to blend the tomatoes until smooth with no large chucks (you can also blend it in batches with a blender).
6. Add 2 tablespoons lemon juice to 9 or 10 hot 1-quart jars (depending on how much sauce you have). Ladle hot mixture into jars, leaving 1/2 in headspace at the top. Remove air bubbles; wipe rims, and adjust lids.
7. For water bath canning process for 40 minutes in a boiling-water canner.
8. Enjoy!
