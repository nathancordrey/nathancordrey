## History

- On Labor Day Sunday 9/3/23 Rhonda, Randy, Rachel and Nathan did 100 ears (50 bi-color and 50 white). Rachel found that the silk was much harder to remove on the white.

- Randy and Rhonda bought 100 bi-color ears from Little Wagon for $48 on 9/6/23 and processed it on 9/7/23. Randy blanched it in garage, Rhonda and Patty cut it from cob and Rose bagged it. The entire 100 ears took around 3 hours to husk, blanch, cut, bag and cleanup.
