# Lemon Lavender Cake

Rachel's Birthday Cake!

## Cake Ingredients

- 3 cups (360 g) all-purpose flour
- 2 1/2 tsp baking powder
- 1/2 tsp baking soda
- 1/2 tsp kosher salt
- 2 cups (400 g) sugar
- 2 tbs lemon zest (~4 lemons)
- 1 tbs Dried culinary lavender
- 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, room temp
- 1/2 cup (120 ml) vegetable oil
- 4 large eggs, room temp
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 1/3 cup fresh lemon juice
- 1 cup whole milk

## Icing Ingredients

- 1 1/2 cup (3 sticks) unsalted butter, room temp
- 6 cups (680 g) powdered sugar
- 1/3 cup (80 ml)
- 1 tbs lemon extract
 
## Ingredients

1. Preheat oven to 350Â°F
2. Prepare the pans. Grease 2 8 inch round cake pans with butter. Line the cake pans with parchment paper and grease the paper. Dust the bottom and sides of the pans with flour and tap out the excess.
3. Combine the dry ingredients. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.
4. Infuse the sugar. In the bowl of a food processor add sugar, lemon zest, and dried lavender. Mix until distributed throuh the sugar, 1-3 minutes.
5. Beat the butter, oil, and sugar in a stand mixer with the paddle attachment, or a hand mixer. Beat on medium high speed until very pale and fluffy, about 4 minutes. The mixture will double or triple in volume.
6. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating until fully combined. Scrape down the sides with a rubber spatula. Stir in the vanilla extract.
7. Add one half of the flour mixture into the butter mixture and mix on low speed until incorporated. Pour in the milk and lemon juice and continue mixing on low speed until just combined. 
8. Add the rest of the flour mixture and mix on low speed until just incoporated (A few lumps are okay do not overmix)
9. Divide the batter evenly between hte cake pans. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. The edges of the cake will begin to pull away from the sides, and the center of the cake should spring back when gently poked with your finger.
10. Let the cake cool on a wire rack to cool completely before frosting.
11. To make the frosting in a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, or in a large mixing bowl with a hand mixer, beat the butter on medium speed until smooth and satiny, about 2 minutes.
12. Add the powdered sugar, half of the milk, and the lemon extract and continue beating on medium speed until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. If the frosting is too thick, add more milk, 1 tbs at a time until desired consistency.
13. To assemble the cake, place one of the cake layers right-side up on a large plate or a 10" cardboard cake round. Use an offset spatula or a butter knife to spread a thick layer of frosting, 1/2 to 1 cup. Top with the remaining cake layer, placed upside down so the top layer is smooth and flat. Check that the cake layers are centered and the top of the cake is level. Gently adjust as needed.
14. Apply the crumb coat (a thin layer of icing where you can still see the cake through it) on all sides.
15. Refrigerate the cake for 20 minutes to allow the frosting to set. Cover the bowl of frosting.
16. Remove the cake from the refrigerator, and stir the frosting to smooth it out. Spread a generous amount of frosting on all sides. 
17. Enjoy! The cake will keep for 4 days covered in a cake saver on the counter.
