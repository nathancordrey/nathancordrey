- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon onion powder
- 1 teaspoon paprika

2. Line a roasting pan with foil at the bottom
3. Mix all the dry ingredients
4. Place the roast on a plate and coat with worchestershire sauce
5. Rub all dry seasonings on the roast
6. Once the loin is at room temperature roast at 425 F for 15 minutes

8. Let rest for 10 minutes before slicing
