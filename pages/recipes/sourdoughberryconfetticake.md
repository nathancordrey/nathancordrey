# Sourdough Berry Confetti Snack Cake

A soft, kid-friendly snack cake made with sourdough discard and freeze-dried berries.  
Lightly tangy, naturally colorful, and easy to make with pantry staples.

This version uses an overnight ferment for better flavor and tenderness.


## Ingredients

### Fermented base (night before)
- 1 cup sourdough discard (240 g)
- 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour (180 g)
- 1/2 cup milk (120 g)

### Remaining ingredients (day of baking)
- 3/4 cup sugar (150 g)
- 2 large eggs (~100 g without shells)
- 1/2 cup neutral oil or melted butter (110 g)
- 1 tsp vanilla extract (5 g)
- 1/2 tsp salt (3 g)
- 1 tsp baking soda (5 g)
- 1/2 cup freeze-dried berries (15 g)  
  *(strawberry, raspberry, blackberry, cherry mix recommended)*
- 1 tsp all-purpose flour (5 g, for tossing berries)


## Instructions

### The Night Before
1. In a large bowl, mix sourdough discard, flour, and milk until combined.
2. Cover loosely and leave at room temperature for 8–12 hours.  
   *(Cool rooms are ideal.)*

### The Next Day
3. Heat oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease an 8×8 or 9×13 pan.
4. Whisk sugar, eggs, oil (or butter), vanilla, and salt into the fermented batter.
5. Lightly crush freeze-dried berries into small flakes and dust.
6. Toss berries with flour; set aside.
7. Sprinkle baking soda evenly over the batter and gently fold to combine.
8. Fold in berries just until distributed.
9. Pour batter into prepared pan.

### Bake
- **8×8 pan:** 34–38 minutes  
- **9×13 pan:** 28–32 minutes  

Cake is done when the center springs back and a toothpick shows moist crumbs.


## Simple Icing (Optional)

A light glaze that adds sweetness and highlights the berry color without overpowering the cake.

### Ingredients
- 1 cup powdered sugar (120 g)
- 1–2 tbsp milk, cream, or lemon juice (15–30 g)
- 1–2 tsp finely crushed freeze-dried berries (2–4 g, optional)

### Instructions
1. Whisk powdered sugar with 1 tbsp liquid until smooth.
2. Add more liquid a few drops at a time until pourable.
3. Stir in crushed berries if using.
4. Drizzle or spread thinly over cooled cake.


## Notes

- Add 1 extra tablespoon sugar (12–15 g) if berries are very tart.
- Do not add baking soda during the overnight ferment.
- Can be baked as cupcakes (18–20 minutes).
- Serve plain, iced, or with whipped cream.
