# Sweet Potato Coconut Milk Stew

Made for the first time in October 2024 with fresh kale. Turned out delicious!
  
## Ingredients
- 1 tbs coconut oil
- 1 medium yellow onion, diced small
- 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper
- 1/2 tsp ground coriander
- 1/2 tsp ground turmeric
- 2 tsp ginger paste
- 3 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
- Salt and Pepper to taste
- 1 1/2 lbs sweet potatoes, peeled and diced into 1-inch pieces
- 1 cup lentils
- 6 cups chicken broth
- 13.5 oz can full fat coconut Milk
- 1 small bunch kale, stems removed and leaves chopped (about 4 cups)
- To garnish: chopped cilantro, pumpkin seeds, extra chili flakes

## Instructions
1. Heat coconut oil in a dutch oven, saute onions for 5 minutes (until translucent). 
2. Add the cayenne, coiander, cumin, and turmeric and saute until fragrant (about 1 minute).
3. Add the ginger and garlic and saute for another minute, then add salt and pepper.
4. Add the sweet potatoes and the lentils, season with salt and pepper, then add the chicken stock and scrape the brown bits from the pan.
5. Bring to a boil
6. Once the stew is boiling, lower to a simmer and set lid askew. Simmer until lentils are tender and sweet potatoes are almost falling apart (about 30 minutes). The liquid should be reduced by a third.
7. Add the coconut milk and kale to the pot, place the lid on top and simmer until kale is bright green and wilted (about 3-4 minutes)
8. Bring the stew back to a simmer and taste and adjust seasonings as needed
9. Serve with chopped cilantro, chili flakes, and pumpkin seeds
