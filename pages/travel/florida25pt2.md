# Florida 2025


## Monday April 28th:

On Monday we made the trip to St Augustine on a mission for shark teeth. We spent the day at Vilano beach. We had a great day playing in the waves and on the beach. 
Unfortunately we did not find any shark teeth.

After the beach we went to downtown St. Augustine and got ice cream and played at the playgroud. We ended up getting delicious BBQ for dinner.


## Tuesday April 29th:

We spent the day at Aquatica, the waterpark connected to Sea World, we ended up getting a good deal for tickets. This worked out as a great day for the waterpark.

The park opened at 10:30 AM and closed at 5:00 pm. The park was not very crowded and the kids did not wait in any lines for the slides.
