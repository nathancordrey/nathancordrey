# Florida 2025


## Wednesday April 30th:

Wednesday was a calmer day. We stayed local and took the trip up to Salt Springs Recreation Area. We did the bear swap trail first, about a mile loop in the woods. After that we spent the day swimming and exploring Salt Springs. We saw our first alligator in the wild and enjoyed a relaxing day.


## Thursday April 31s:

Thursday was our Disney day where we spent the day at Animal Kingdom. Unfortunately Luke was not feeling well in the morning and threw up most of the morning. He powered through and was feeling better in the afternoon and we had a great time! We especially enjoyed the Safari which we did twice. We also enjoyed the Nemo and Lion King shows as a nice break.

## Friday May 1st

We had a peaceful morning and packed up. We did a quick pitstop at a playground on the way to the Airport. After that we had a nice flight home where both kids slept the whole flight home!
