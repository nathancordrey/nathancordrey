# Iceland 2017

## Sunday May 14th

We drove back towards the airport to visit Blue lagoon in the morning for our 11 AM reservation. We had a great time exploring the pools.

We also checked out the Gunnuhuver hot springs.

That evening we stayed at the Tjaldsvaedi campsite and prepared for our trip around the Golden Circle the next day.
